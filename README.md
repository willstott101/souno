**A pet (and very ambitious) project that I probably wont have much time to work on.**
***
>  Highly **modular** media **player**, and **manager**.  

> Focusing on **extensibility** and **simplicity**. As tools to produce a **beautiful** and **portable** music player... finder... sharer... experience.

Using git-hosted modules which extend the player in any way imaginable.  
Using the benefits of an interpreted language to create extensible code.  
Ignoring the paradigms of digital music players.  
Striving to be the most feature-rich media-player on the planet.  

> Desperate to **break the stagnation** of desktop music players, and using **Electron** to do it.

Current dev team: 1

**Modules**:
* **Core** module controller.
* **Player(s)** swappable player backend (interested in libvlc, libgroove, and chromium's <audio>)
* **Queue** as we know and love. But... with a history.
* **View(s)** a front-end concept providing views into specific modules.
* **Finder(s)** inspired by Tomahawk's resolvers.
