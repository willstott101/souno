**A pet (and very ambitious) project that I probably wont have much time to work on.**
***
>  Highly **modular** media **player**, and **manager**.  

After getting fed up with how closed iTunes is, and not finding an open-source project which had the same priorities I have. I decided to try and take a very different approach.  

This approach will be extremely modular, following a similar model to atom.io

> Putting **ease** before **speed**, and **deployability** before **features**.

Using git-hosted modules which extend the player in any way imaginable.  
Using the benefits of an interpreted language to create extensible code.  
Ignoring the paradigms of digital music players.  
Striving to be the most feature-rich media-player on the planet.  

> Desperate to **break the stagnation** of desktop music players.
